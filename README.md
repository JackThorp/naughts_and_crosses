NAUGHTS AND CROSSES

A personal project to reconnect with full JS stack inc React, Node, Express, MongoDB, SocketIO + build tools.

To start the node server (src/server/index.js) run 'npm start'

The objective is to build a naughts and crosses game that can be played in the browser. I will start simple with a game to be played locally between two humans
and then proceed to add features of additioal complexity. 

Feature & Extensions list:
- Allow replay and keep track of the scores.
- Add vs computer mode
- Enable choice of grid from 3x3 to 10x10.
- Enable two player mode between seperate browsers i.e. set up a game server. 
- Allow players to draw their own symbols
- Allow players to create log ins and persist scores / high scores etc
