NAUGHTS AND CROSSES

Build a naughts and crosses game that can be played in the browser. The game should be set up for person vs computer on a 3x3 grid. A button should be pressed to start the game 
and the first player is chosen fairly but at random. The first player is naughts and the second player is crosses. The players take it in turn to fill in a square on the gird.
The game is won when one player has managed to get three of their symbols in a row.
